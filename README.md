# TETA

This project was created at HEX 2018, a MLH hackathon in Eindhoven NL, by a group of pretty awesome dudes.

## What is it about?

This project is part of the *future society* track and tackles the problem of bringing together people who master a certain skill and people who would like to learn this skill. 
The masters (teachers) can provide courses for the students willing to learn.
The students can enroll in a course, learn about the topic and - after a completed and passed exam - recieve a reward.
This reward is generally coupled with the course, enabling the student to put his newly learned skill into practice.

## What we did.

To demo our concept we developed a web app for the students and teachers to either take or respectivly manage the course.
